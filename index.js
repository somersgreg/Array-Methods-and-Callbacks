// >  A BAD CONSOLE LOG HERE WAS STOPPING THE REST OF MY CODE FROM RUNNING
// >  FOR THIS STUPID REASON I DELETED ALL MY WORK.
// <  I NEED A WAY TO WRITE A LOT OF CODE THATS ONLY FOR TESTING BUT NOT DELETE THAT CODE WHEN I FINALLY DECIDE WHICH TO GO WITH. 
// <  I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO WATCH THE CODE RUN IN CONSOLE AND STEP SO I CAN DEBUG BETTER
// <  I NEED TO HAVE A METHOD FOR DOING SURE INTERVAL CHACKS TO MAKE SURE MY CODE IS RUNNING
// <  I COULD ANNOUNCE LINE NUMBERS SOMEHOW MAYBE IF I KNOW HOW TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION

// <  Now i want to search for the index matching the year but not with a loop (although it the same 'under the hood)
// <  P$UEDOCODEING: I WANT TO FIND FIFADATA[I#] FOR THE USER DEFINED YEAR AND THEN APPLY THAT IN A SIMPLE CONSOLE LOG TO POP OFF ALL THE DESIRED INFO.

// NOTES: forEach is the "loop through them all" function, but ES5 defined several other useful "work your way through the array and do things" functions, including:
// every (stops looping the first time the callback returns false or something falsey)
// some (stops looping the first time the callback returns true or something truthy)
// filter (creates a new array including elements where the filter function returns true and omitting the ones where it returns false)
// map (creates a new array from the values returned by the callback)
// reduce (builds up a value by repeatedly calling the callback, passing in previous values; see the spec for the details; useful for summing the contents of an array and many other things)
// reduceRight (like reduce, but works in descending rather than ascending order)

// Find the index of an item in the Array
// fruits.push('Mango')
// // ["Strawberry", "Banana", "Mango"]
// let pos = fruits.indexOf('Banana')
// // 1

// < For some.year === year then console log i.
